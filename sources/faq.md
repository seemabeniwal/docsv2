# FAQ

Having trouble with your builds? Here is a list of frequently asked
questions.... hope this helps!

## How do I update my Shippable plan?
- Login to Shippable
- Click on the subscription you want to upgrade from the `Organizations` list on your right
- You will see a `Plan and Billing` icon on the top right of the Subscription Page. Click on the icon to see and/or update your plan

## Why can't I see some of my repositories in my Shippable account?

This happens due to one of the following reasons:

- You haven't enabled private repositories in your Shippable account.  If this is the reason, please click on the 'Private repos off' icon on your dashboard and give us permissions to access your private repositories.
- Your account hasn't yet been synced with the latest permissions from GitHub. To fix
this, please click on the 'Sync account' icon on your dashboard.
-  You're a BitBucket user and you have mercurial repositories. We do not support mercurial at this time, so you will need to convert them to git or use another platform for CI.

## Why do I get an error when I try to enable a project that is listed on my dashboard?

This usually happens if you are a collaborator on a project and the
owner of the project has not given Shippable access to the project. You
can verify this by confirming that the owner of the project can see the
project on their Shippable dashboard.

## I have enabled my repository and committed code, but my build doesn't start. What could be wrong?

Please check the 'Notifications' tab on your repository page on
Shippable. If it shows any errors, fix those and try again.

If the error shows a parsing failure for the yml, you can validate the
file at [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/).

## Why can't I see my BitBucket repos in my Shippable account?

Shippable only supports git based repositories, so if you have mercurial
repositories in your BitBucket account, you will not see them in the
Shippable repository list. If you cannot see git based repos, please
open an issue on our [GitHub Support
repo](<https://github.com/Shippable/support>).

## Why can't shippable see my org on github?

Github's default policy when a new org is created is 'access
restricted'. In order for Shippable to be able to see the org, you must
manually grant access to Shippable. This can be resolved by going to the
third-party access section for the org, and clicking 'Remove
restrictions' Under the 'Third-party application access policy' section.

## How do I link my github and bitbucket accounts?

Shippable allows you to link both github and bitbucket service providers
into a single account. Click on the bitbucket icon or github icon on the
top right to link the respective account from the dashboard page.

For example: Sign in to shippable with your github account and click on
the bitbucket icon on the top right to link your bitbucket account.

If you have already logged in to shippable with both the service
providers account separately, then it will not allow you to link the
accounts. You have to delete one of your shippable account and then
click on the respective service provider icon from the other account.
Deleting the account will also remove all its associated projects and
builds, so first you need to decide which account you want to delete and
then delete the account from the profile dropdown.

## Why am I not able to see BitBucket org repos after deleting and recreating my account on Shippable?

Deleting the shippable account will also delete all the permissions
associated with the account. If you recreate your account, bitbucket
will not allow us to pull all the permissions you have, unless the owner
of that organization logs in back to shippable and then click on the
sync repos button to see the repos.

## How do I set desired timezones inside the minions?

By default, our minions are configured with ETC/UTC timezone which is
set in /etc/timezone file for ubuntu minions. However, we allow you to
set a specific time zone for the minion in before\_script section of
your yml file . For example,

```yml
before_script:
  - echo 'Europe/Paris' | sudo tee /etc/timezone
  - sudo dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata
```

This will change your minion timezone to paris time. Refer the article
[list of tz database time zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) to select the timezone for your location.
