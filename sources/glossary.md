# Glossary

Definitions of terms used in Shippable documentation

## Subscriptions

A default subscription is created for every user account so that
Shippable can group CI projects under a common entity. A default free
subscription is created on signup with quotas as per our pricing plans.
Users can upgrade this free subscription to a paid plan and receive
higher quotas.

## Minions

Minions are containers that will run your builds and tests. The more
minions you have, the more builds you can run in parallel. Each minion
starts from a base image and can be further customized by specifying
before_install scripts in the YML file.

## Projects

A Project is used to handle builds/CI/CD on your repo. You need to
create a project for each repo you want CI enabled. Every project is
under a subscription and your limits/quotas are tracked at the
subscription level.
