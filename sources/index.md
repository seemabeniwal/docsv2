# Overview

## What is Shippable?

Shippable is a SaaS platform for developers and devops teams that enables 
frictionless development and automated deployment of multi-tier applications.  
You can easily add Continuous Integration to your git repositories and  
manage multi-container environments without writing any DevOps code or managing infrastructure. 
Shippable leverages Docker, the fastest growing linux container solution internally. 

Shippable comprises of two products:

### Shippable CI 
Shippable CI is our Continuous Integration and Deployment Platform
which is lightweight, super simple to setup, and runs your builds and tests
faster than any other service. It uses **Build Minions** which are docker based 
containers to run your workloads.  After building and testing your code, you can push your docker image
to Docker Hub, Google Container Registry or any other private registry. You
can also deploy it to any PaaS provider like Heroku & OpenShift and also to
VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, or any major infrastructure
provider. 

### Shippable Formations
Shippable Formations is a system based on Kubernetes that allows you to manage your multi-tier 
application across multiple environments without writing any DevOps code. It is persistent, fully orchestrated 
and scalable. Each of your developers can now have their own fully integrated test environment at a fraction of the cost! 

With Shippable Formations, you can:
- manage multi-container environments that can be easily configured by developers or DevOps teams.
- no code deployment and rollback
- easily integrate with existing services
- persistent, fully orchestrated and scalable
- no machine provisioning required
