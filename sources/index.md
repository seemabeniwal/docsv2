# Overview

## What is Shippable?

Shippable is a SaaS platform that enables frictionless development and deployment
of multi-tier applications. You can easily add Continuous Integration and Deployment
to your Git repositories, manage infrastructure across multi-container environments
without writing any DevOps code. Shippable leverages Docker, the fastest growing linux 
container solution internally. 

Shippable comprises of two products:

### Shippable CI 
Shippable CI is our Continuous Integration and Deployment Platform
which is lightweight, super simple to setup, and runs your builds and tests
faster than any other service. It uses **Build Minions** which are docker based 
containers to run your workloads.  After building and testing your code, you
can deploy it to any PaaS provider like Heroku & OpenShift and also to
VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, or any major infrastructure
provider.

### Shippable Formations
Shippable Formations is a brand new product that allows you to manage
your application across multiple environments without worrying about infrastructure. You can
auto deploy your applications and rollback with one click using Formations.
